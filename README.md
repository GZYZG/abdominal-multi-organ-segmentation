abdominal multi-organ segmentation using pytorch

the data come from an online challenge called **Multi-atlas labeling Beyond the Cranial Vault**, for the detail, you can check this link:**https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn3193805/wiki/217752**.in this challenge, the task is to segement 13 different kind of organ as follow:
